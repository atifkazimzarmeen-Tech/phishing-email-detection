# phishing-email-detection
A machine learning–based system for detecting phishing emails using text preprocessing and classification techniques.
#  Phishing Email Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model to detect phishing emails**.  
The system analyzes email text and classifies it as **Phishing** or **Legitimate** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
